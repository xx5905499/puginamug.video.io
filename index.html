I'll always show up
I don't ever slow up, no I don't take shit
I got no love for the fakeness
If you wanna play tough and wanna hate this
I'll always show up, and make a statement
I don't ever slow up, no I don't take shit
I got no love for the fakeness
If you wanna play tough and wanna hate this
I'll always show up, and make a statement
Everything I do so instinctive and so passionate
Every word I move so descriptive like an adjective
I got a vendetta against people who patented
Being negative when you should be getting after it
I got facts over facts, over tracks
This and that spitting slow spitting fast
I can roast I can gas think I'm ok at last
But I don't know if that can erase all the past
And the pettiness, a reflection of the emptiness
Hilarious, you think your worth my time your delirious
Mysterious, because you hide behind a fake exterior
Inferior, you know I'll always be a bit superior
Get off of me, this ain't no humblebrag
I want you to hear words you can say them back
I want you to feel free from the chains at last
And to believe in what you got it was built to last, yeah
Now that I've been put through hell
I never got anyone's help
I had to do it all myself
I don't ever slow up, no I don't take shit
I got no love for the fakeness
If you wanna play tough and wanna hate this
I'll always show up, and make a statement
I don't ever slow up, no I don't take shit
I got no love for the fakeness
If you wanna play tough and wanna hate this
I'll always show up, and make a statement
They gonna learn the consequence of being incompetent
Mental health is confidence, dreams and some honest-ness
I'm not here to save the day, that's for you to take away
I could play a million mind games but instead, I say
Something not illogical, something that is topical
Rub it on and watch it go, make yourself unstoppable
Dreams are irresponsible, but they're always possible
If you just believe you could be so remarkable
I got these thoughts in my head, a collage, and they spread
I'll be great one day going off of my meds
No, I'm not giving up, no I'm not giving in
I will make it to the top, taking off in the wind
I gotta make it, I'm slaving every day to taste it
I'm patient, but my mind it can hardly take it
I'm chasing, a dream that I've had for several ages
A vacant, modern kingdom for the taking
Now that I've been put through hell
I never got anyone's help
I had to do it all myself
I don't ever slow up, no I don't take shit
I got no love for the fakeness
If you wanna play tough and wanna hate this
I'll always show up, and make a statement
I don't ever slow up, no I don't take shit
I got no love for the fakeness
If you wanna play tough and wanna hate this
I'll always show up, and make a statement
I don't ever slow up, no I don't take shit
I got no love for the fakeness
If you wanna play tough and wanna hate this
I'll always show up
